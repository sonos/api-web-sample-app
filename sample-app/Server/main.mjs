 * This file defines and initiates the server that listens for Sonos API events, along with the WebSocket connection between the server

 * Sonos API sends events to the ngrok URL, which the server receives at port 8080. The server then sends this request to the WebSocket at port 8000
 * The client can then receive that event in MuseEventHandler by listening to "ws://localhost:8000" (see socket.js)
